          <h3>Best Rate is a family business</h3>
          <p>Hello, my name is Dennis Dziegielewski, I'm a master plumber, and the owner of Best Rate Plumbing.  I have over 20 years experience doing commercial and residential plumbing, and I have enjoyed every minute of it.  My son is currently apprenticing under me, as he wishes to be a plumber himself.  He can usually be seen drawing on your walls with his crayons, but hey, he's still learning!  My daughter also likes to help out, and she handles my accounting when I get really busy.  So if you get charged in ponies, please be patient.</p>
